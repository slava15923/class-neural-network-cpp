<h1 align="center">This is just a template for creating a layered neural network</h1>
usage:
<h3>w - weights</h3>
<h3>ra - you can put a number there. usage example: l1.ra = 1;</h3>
<h3>l1.corW(1,l1.ra);</h3>
<h3>l1.ra++;</h3>
<h3>NumNeiron - number of neurons</h3>
<h3>NumNextLayerNeiron - number of neurons in the next layer</h3>
<h3>learning_rate - learning rate</h3>
<h3>input - the input data MUST BE AN ARRAY, the get() and get1layer() FUNCTIONS also return arrays in response</h3>
<h3>getfirstweight() - create random weights</h3>
<h3>get() - calculation of neurons if there are 2 or more of them per input</h3>
<h3>get1layer() - calculation of neurons if there are 1 of them</h3>
<h3>corW(1, 0) - adjustment of weights 1 argument is responsible for increasing and decreasing 1 = decrease the weight of the neuron, -1 = increase the weight of the neuron. 2nd argument is the number of the neuron that is being corrected</h3>
<h3>PrintW() - output to the console of weights</h3>
